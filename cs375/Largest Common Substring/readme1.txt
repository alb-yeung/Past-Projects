Simply using `make` will make all three programs.
Or do `g++ lcs1.cpp timeProg.h -o program1`
Use by
./program1 <input-file1> <input-file2> <output-file>

Program1 uses a 2D array to store the LCS for the substrings
It uses dynamic programming in a bottom-up approach to calculate the LCS for two strings.
